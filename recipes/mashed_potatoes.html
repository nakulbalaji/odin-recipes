    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make mashed potatoes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the potatoes: Add the potatoes and garlic to a large pot of salted, boiling water. Reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender.</li>
        <li>Heat the milk: Heat the milk and butter in a saucepan until the butter is melted.</li>
        <li>Mash the potatoes: Drain the potatoes, then return them to the pot. Slowly add the warm milk mixture, mashing with a potato masher or blending with a mixer until the potatoes are smooth and creamy. Season to taste.</li>
       
    </ol>
